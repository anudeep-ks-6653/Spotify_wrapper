## 📝 Recent Changes

### April 29, 2026

#### Queue API Contract Upgrade (id/type)
- Updated `POST /api/spotify/queue/add` to accept either:
  - `uri` (backward compatible), or
  - `id` + `type` (`track`, `album`, `playlist`)
- Backend now resolves `id` + `type` into queueable track URIs and adds them in a loop server-side
- Added backend helpers to fetch album/playlist tracks with pagination and queue all resolved URIs

#### Album Queueing Update
- Added `GET /api/spotify/albums/tracks` endpoint for album track retrieval
- Search album cards now use **Add to Queue** with `id` + `type=album`
- Removed frontend album queue loops in favor of backend centralized expansion

### April 28, 2026

#### Queue Management + Artist Link UX
- Added backend queue endpoints:
  - `GET /api/spotify/queue`
  - `POST /api/spotify/queue/add`
- Added `QueueDto` for queue response parsing
- Added frontend queue API methods (`getQueue`, `addToQueue`) in `spotify.js`
- Added **Add to Queue** buttons:
  - Search track cards
  - Library liked songs cards
  - Library recently played cards
- Added **Current Queue** panel in Player tab with manual refresh button
- Player module now refreshes queue alongside playback updates
- Artist names are now clickable links to Spotify artist pages in Player/Search/Library track contexts

#### Operational Notes
- Queue actions require an active Spotify device
- Existing scopes already cover queue operations:
  - `user-read-playback-state`
  - `user-modify-playback-state`
- Backend restart required after queue endpoint additions

### April 16, 2026

#### Combined Search: All Mode
- Added an `All` option to the search type selector in `frontend/index.html`
- The search UI now maps `All` to a single backend request with `type=track,album,playlist`
- Search results are rendered in grouped sections for Songs, Albums, and Playlists using the existing result card templates
- Existing single-type search behavior remains unchanged for track, artist, album, and playlist filters

#### Keyboard Shortcut Enhancement: Shift + Arrow Seek
- Added global keyboard seek shortcuts in `player.js` for the active Player tab:
  - `Shift + ArrowRight` seeks forward by 5 seconds
  - `Shift + ArrowLeft` seeks backward by 5 seconds
- This behavior works even when the progress bar is not focused, improving keyboard accessibility and usability.
- Existing keyboard behavior remains unchanged:
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + ArrowRight` for next track
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + ArrowLeft` for previous track
  - Focused progress bar `ArrowRight/ArrowLeft` for ±5 second seek

### April 15, 2026 (Afternoon Update)

#### WCAG Level A Accessibility Compliance
- **Objective:** Achieve WCAG 2.1 Level A accessibility compliance
- **Implementation Areas:**

  **Sidebar Navigation Tabs**
  - Added `role="tablist"` to sidebar nav container
  - Added `role="tab"` to each nav button
  - Added `aria-selected` attribute (true/false) updated dynamically on tab switch
  - Added `aria-controls` linking each tab button to its content panel ID
  - Tab content panels now have `role="tabpanel"` and `aria-labelledby` linking back to their tabs
  - Updated `switchTab()` in `app.js` to handle all ARIA attribute changes

  **Progress Bar (Seek Control)**
  - Added `role="slider"` to progress bar container
  - Added `aria-label="Progress bar"`
  - Added `aria-valuenow` (current position in ms), updated during track playback
  - Added `aria-valuemin="0"`
  - Added `aria-valuemax` (total duration in ms)
  - Added `tabindex="0"` for keyboard accessibility
  - Implemented `handleSeekKeyboard()` for Left/Right arrow keys (±5 second increments)
  - Updated `aria-valuenow` when seeking via keyboard or click

  **Volume Slider**
  - Added `aria-label="Volume"`

  **Icon-Only Buttons**
  - Added `aria-label` to 6 buttons: Search, Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Volume Down, Volume Up
  - Made Play/Pause `aria-label` dynamic ("Play" when paused, "Pause" when playing)
  - Updated dynamically in `updatePlayPauseButton()` as playback state changes

  **Library Sub-Tabs**
  - All library sub-tab panels (Recently Played, Liked Songs, My Playlists) now have:
    - `role="tabpanel"`
    - `aria-labelledby` linking to their tab button by ID

  **Focus Management**
  - Tab content panels receive keyboard focus when activated
  - Implemented via `tabindex="-1"` and `.focus()` call in `switchTab()`
  - Allows screen reader users to navigate between main sections

- **Files Modified:**
  - `frontend/index.html` - Added ARIA roles, labels, and attributes to HTML elements
  - `frontend/js/app.js` - Enhanced `switchTab()` to manage dynamic ARIA attributes and focus
  - `frontend/js/player.js` - Added `handleSeekKeyboard()` method, dynamic play/pause label updates

- **Compliance:**
  - Estimated 90%+ WCAG 2.1 Level A compliance achieved
  - All major accessibility criteria implemented (semantic HTML, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, focus management)
  - Remaining minor items: Link contrast ratios, form labels (if applicable)

### April 15, 2026

#### Seek Playback Feature
- **Backend:**
  - Added `seek()` method to `SpotifyService` — calls `PUT /me/player/seek?position_ms={ms}` on Spotify API
  - Added `PUT /api/spotify/seek` endpoint to `SpotifyController`
- **Frontend:**
  - Added `SEEK` endpoint to `config.js`
  - Added `SpotifyAPI.seek()` method to `spotify.js`
  - Made progress bar clickable to seek to any position
  - Added current time and duration labels alongside progress bar
  - Added hover tooltip on progress bar showing time at mouse position
  - Added `handleSeek()`, `handleSeekTooltip()`, and `formatTime()` to `PlayerModule`

#### Added +/- Seek Buttons
- Added buttons for -15s, -10s, -5s (left) and +5s, +10s, +15s (right) around playback controls
- Added `handleSeekBySeconds()` handler in `PlayerModule`

#### UI Reordering
- **Sidebar:** Reordered to Player (default) → Search → Library → Devices
- **Library sub-tabs:** Reordered to Recently Played (default) → Liked Songs → My Playlists
- Updated `app.js` default tab from `'search'` to `'player'`
- Updated tab content visibility classes to match new defaults

#### Bug Fix: Recently Played Stuck on Initial Load
- **Problem:** After reordering Library sub-tabs, Recently Played (now the default) never loaded on first visit
- **Cause:** `onTabActivated()` in `library.js` always loaded playlists (old default) and never triggered `loadRecentlyPlayed()` since Bootstrap `shown.bs.tab` doesn't fire for the already-active tab
- **Solution:** Updated `onTabActivated()` to check which sub-tab is actually active and load the correct content

#### CSS: Cursor Pointer Cleanup
- Removed `cursor: pointer` from `.search-result-card` and `.device-card`
- Hand cursor now only appears on actual clickable `<button>` elements

#### Player Update Interval
- Player seeker update interval set to 10 seconds in `config.js`

#### Volume Step Up/Down Buttons
- Added volume down (`-`) and volume up (`+`) buttons flanking the volume slider
- Each click adjusts by `CONFIG.PLAYER.VOLUME_STEP` (2%)
- Reuses existing debounced `handleVolumeChange()` flow

#### Common Tooltip Refactor
- Replaced separate `#seek-tooltip` and `#volume-tooltip` with a single shared `#player-tooltip`
- Uses `position: fixed` with `pageX`/`pageY` so it works consistently for both controls
- Volume tooltip shows value at cursor position (not current slider value)

#### Fixed Duplicate Player Update Calls
- **Problem:** Switching tabs triggered duplicate `updateCurrentTrack()` API calls
- **Cause:** `init()` called both `startUpdateLoop()` and `updateCurrentTrack()` separately; `refresh()` and seek handlers added extra calls outside the loop
- **Solution:**
  - Removed standalone `updateCurrentTrack()` from `init()`
  - Added `isUpdating` guard to prevent concurrent calls
  - `refresh()` now restarts the loop via `startUpdateLoop()` instead of calling `updateCurrentTrack()` directly
  - Seek handlers restart the loop instead of using `setTimeout`

### March 5, 2026

#### Fixed Missing Spotify Scopes for Library Endpoints
- **Problem:** Recently played API returning 403 Forbidden, Liked Songs returning empty
- **Cause:** Missing OAuth scopes in `application.properties`
- **Solution:** Added required scopes to `spotify.scope`:
  - `user-read-recently-played` - for recently played tracks
  - `user-library-read` - for liked songs
  - `playlist-read-collaborative` - for collaborative playlists
- **Action Required:** Users must re-login to Spotify to grant the new permissions

#### Fixed Duplicate Method in spotify.js
- **Problem:** `SpotifyAPI.getLikedSongs is not a function` error
- **Cause:** Duplicate `transferPlayback` method at end of file caused syntax issues
- **Solution:** Removed duplicate method and fixed trailing comma

#### Fixed Merge Conflict in library.js
- **Problem:** `library.js` had duplicate method definitions and malformed code from failed merge
- **Solution:** Recreated the file with clean, properly structured code
- **File:** `/frontend/js/library.js` - completely rewritten

#### Refactored Library.js to Use SpotifyAPI Module
- **Problem:** `library.js` used direct `$.ajax()` calls inconsistent with other modules
- **Solution:** Refactored to use `SpotifyAPI` module for consistent API handling:
  - Added library endpoints to `config.js`: `MY_PLAYLISTS`, `LIKED_SONGS`, `RECENTLY_PLAYED`
  - Added new methods to `spotify.js`: `getMyPlaylists()`, `getLikedSongs()`, `getRecentlyPlayed()`
  - Rewrote `library.js` load methods to use `SpotifyAPI` instead of direct AJAX
  - Changed auth check from `Auth.getUserId()` to `SpotifyAPI.userId`
  - Updated play handlers to use async/await with `SpotifyAPI.playPlaylist()` and `SpotifyAPI.playTrack()`
  - Changed device reference from `Player.getCurrentDeviceId()` to `PlayerModule.deviceId`

#### Bug Fix: Missing `Auth.getUserId()` Method
- **Problem:** `library.js` called `Auth.getUserId()` which didn't exist in `auth.js`
- **Error:** `Unhandled promise rejection: TypeError: Auth.getUserId is not a function`
- **Solution:** Added `getUserId()` method to `Auth` module in `auth.js`:
  - Returns `currentUser.userId` if available
  - Falls back to `localStorage.getItem(CONFIG.STORAGE_KEYS.USER_ID)`

#### Library Feature Implementation
- **Backend:**
  - Added `getMyPlaylists()` method to `SpotifyService`
  - Added `getLikedSongs()` method with `SavedTracksResponse` DTO
  - Added `getRecentlyPlayed()` method with `RecentlyPlayedResponse` DTO
  - Created inner DTOs: `SavedTracksResponse`, `SavedTrackItem`, `RecentlyPlayedResponse`, `CursorsDto`, `PlayHistoryItem`, `ContextDto`
  - Added controller endpoints: `/me/playlists`, `/me/tracks`, `/me/recently-played`

- **Frontend:**
  - Added "My Library" tab in sidebar navigation
  - Created Library sub-tabs: My Playlists, Liked Songs, Recently Played
  - Created `library.js` module with:
    - Lazy loading for each sub-tab
    - Pagination for playlists and liked songs
    - Relative time formatting for recently played
    - Play button integration
  - Added Handlebars templates: `library-playlist-template`, `liked-song-template`, `recently-played-template`
  - Added CSS styles for library tabs and pagination

#### Previous Session Fixes
- Fixed NullPointerException in search (Spotify API returns null items in arrays)
- Added `TracksInfoDto` with `href` and `total` fields
- Fixed volume endpoint to use query params instead of JSON body
- Added Handlebars templating for search results
- Added `uri` field to `PlaylistDto`
- Fixed HTTP Client connection pool exhaustion with `PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager`
- Added `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)` to all DTOs
- Fixed `@Transactional` proxy issues in services

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### 1. Connection Pool Exhaustion
**Problem:** HTTP connections not being released properly  
**Solution:** Added `PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager` to `SpotifyService`:
```java
PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager cm = new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager();
cm.setMaxTotal(100);
cm.setDefaultMaxPerRoute(50);
```

### 2. Unknown JSON Properties
**Problem:** Spotify API returns additional fields not in our DTOs  
**Solution:** Added `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)` to all DTOs

### 3. Null Items in Search Results
**Problem:** Spotify API sometimes returns `null` items in arrays  
**Solution:** Added null filtering in service methods:
```java
.filter(Objects::nonNull)
.collect(Collectors.toList())
```

### 4. HikariCP Connection Issues
**Problem:** Database connections not being properly managed  
**Solution:** Configured HikariCP pool settings and ensured `@Transactional` is on correct methods
