## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

- Java 17 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- A Spotify Developer account

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Spotify App Setup

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Note your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
4. Add `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to your Redirect URIs

### 2. Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE spotify_wrapper;
```

2. Create a MySQL user (optional):
```sql
CREATE USER 'spotify_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON spotify_wrapper.* TO 'spotify_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 3. Backend Configuration

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Copy the template and update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
```bash
cp ../application.properties.template src/main/resources/application.properties
```

3. Edit `application.properties` with your credentials:
```properties
# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spotify_wrapper
spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password

# Spotify API configuration
spotify.client.id=your_spotify_client_id
spotify.client.secret=your_spotify_client_secret
spotify.redirect.uri=http://127.0.0.1:3000
spotify.scope=user-read-private user-read-email playlist-read-private playlist-read-collaborative user-read-playback-state user-modify-playback-state user-library-read user-read-recently-played streaming
```

4. Build and run:
```bash
mvn -f pom.xml org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-maven-plugin:run
```

The backend will start on `http://127.0.0.1:9090`

### 4. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will start on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the startup script to run both backend and frontend:
```bash
./start.sh
```

## Usage

1. **Login**: Click "Login with Spotify" to authenticate with your Spotify account
2. **Player** (Default Tab): Control playback with play/pause, next, and previous buttons. Seek using:
   - Clickable progress bar (shows time on hover)
   - Arrow buttons for ±5/10/15 second jumps
   - Keyboard: **Shift + Left/Right** for ±5 second increments (from anywhere in Player tab)
   - Keyboard (when progress bar is focused): Left/Right for ±5 second increments
   - Volume: Adjust with +/- buttons or slider (shows volume % on hover)
3. **Search**: Use the search tab to find songs, artists, albums, and playlists
4. **Library**: Browse recently played tracks, liked songs, and your playlists (Recently Played is the default sub-tab)
5. **Devices**: View and select available Spotify devices

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab** to navigate between interactive elements
- **Shift + Left/Right** to seek -5/+5 seconds in Player tab
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Left/Right** for previous/next track
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Up/Down** to adjust volume step
- **Arrow keys** to adjust seek/volume when the relevant slider control is focused
- **Enter/Space** to activate buttons

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `GET /auth/login` - Get Spotify authorization URL
- `GET /auth/callback` - Handle OAuth callback
- `GET /auth/user/{userId}` - Get user information

### Spotify Integration
- `GET /api/spotify/search` - Search for tracks, artists, albums, and playlists
- `GET /api/spotify/devices` - Get available devices
- `GET /api/spotify/playback` - Get current playback state
- `POST /api/spotify/play` - Start playback
- `POST /api/spotify/pause` - Pause playback
- `POST /api/spotify/next` - Skip to next track
- `POST /api/spotify/previous` - Skip to previous track
- `POST /api/spotify/transfer` - Transfer playback to device
- `PUT /api/spotify/seek` - Seek to position in current track

### Library
- `GET /api/spotify/me/playlists` - Get user's playlists
- `GET /api/spotify/me/tracks` - Get user's liked songs
- `GET /api/spotify/me/recently-played` - Get recently played tracks

## Database Schema

The application uses a single `users` table to store:
- Spotify user ID
- Display name and email
- Access and refresh tokens
- Token expiration timestamp
- Created/updated timestamps

## Development

### Backend Development
- The application uses Spring Boot with HikariCP connection pooling
- Apache HttpClient with connection pooling for Spotify API calls
- Logs are output to console and `logs/spotify-wrapper.log`
- Configure logging levels in `application.properties`

### Frontend Development
- Live-server provides hot reloading during development
- Uses Handlebars.js for templating
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI components
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX calls

## Security Considerations

- Access tokens are stored securely in the database
- CORS is configured to allow requests from the frontend origin only
- Refresh tokens are automatically used to obtain new access tokens
- All Spotify API calls require valid authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No devices found"**: Make sure Spotify is open and active on at least one device
2. **"Authentication failed"**: Check your Spotify app credentials and redirect URI
3. **"Database connection error"**: Verify MySQL is running and credentials are correct
4. **"CORS error"**: Ensure the frontend URL is properly configured in CORS settings

### Development Tips

- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Monitor backend logs for API call details
- Use Spotify's Web API documentation for reference
- Test with different device types (desktop, mobile, web player)
