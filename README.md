# Spotify Web API Wrapper

A full-stack web application that wraps the Spotify Web API, allowing users to search for music, manage playlists, control playback, and view their library.

## Recent Changes (May 2026)

- Added album detail view modal to browse album items (tracks) with pagination.
- Added album-level **Tracks** button in search result cards.
- Added track actions inside detail view: **Play**, **Add to Queue**, and **Play All** for album context.
- Added frontend module `detail.js` and initialized it during dashboard load.
- Added detail-view Handlebars row template and modal markup in `frontend/index.html`.
- Added detail-view row hover/number styles in `frontend/css/styles.css`.
- Kept scope intentionally limited to **albums only** (playlist detail fetch changes were rolled back).

## Issues Faced During Implementation

- **Module initialization issue**: detail view click handlers did not work initially because the module was not exported to `window`; fixed by exporting `DetailView` and initializing it after login.
- **Playlist track API failures (403)**: Spotify playlist track fetch repeatedly returned 403 (including owned playlists), indicating token/scope/access restrictions in real usage.
- **OAuth re-consent gap**: stale consent state made playlist scope validation difficult; forcing consent dialog helped testing, but playlist-related detail fetch was later removed per scope decision.
- **Manual API test confusion**: requests without a valid persisted `userId` produced user-not-found/5xx behavior while debugging; confirmed frontend path works with authenticated app user context.
- **Feature scope adjustment**: playlist detail-view patches were reverted to reduce instability; album detail view remains the supported path.

## Features

- 🎵 **Search**: Search for songs, artists, albums, and playlists
- 📚 **Library**: View your playlists, liked songs, and recently played tracks
- 🎮 **Playback Control**: Play, pause, skip tracks, seek with clickable progress bar, +/- 5/10/15s buttons, volume step up/down, and hover tooltips on any connected device. Progress bar updates smoothly every 100ms while playing, syncing with Spotify every 15 seconds
- 🔇 **Smart Volume Availability**: Volume slider/buttons are automatically disabled when the current Spotify device does not support volume control
- 🧾 **Queue Management**: Add tracks to queue from Search/Library and view current queue in Player tab
- 🔁 **Bulk Queue Expansion**: Queue requests can accept `id` + `type` (track/album/playlist) and expand to track URIs on the backend
- 📱 **Device Management**: View and switch between available Spotify devices
- 🔐 **OAuth Integration**: Secure authentication with Spotify
- 💾 **Database Storage**: Persistent user data and token management
- 🔄 **Auto-Refresh**: Recently played tracks refresh automatically every minute
- 🔎 **Album Detail View**: Open album track list in a modal with paging and quick playback actions
- ♿ **WCAG Level A Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support, semantic HTML structure

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

- Java 17 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- A Spotify Developer account

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Spotify App Setup

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Note your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
4. Add `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to your Redirect URIs

### 2. Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE spotify_wrapper;
```

2. Create a MySQL user (optional):
```sql
CREATE USER 'spotify_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON spotify_wrapper.* TO 'spotify_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 3. Backend Configuration

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Copy the template and update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
```bash
cp ../application.properties.template src/main/resources/application.properties
```

3. Edit `application.properties` with your credentials:
```properties
# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spotify_wrapper
spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password

# Spotify API configuration
spotify.client.id=your_spotify_client_id
spotify.client.secret=your_spotify_client_secret
spotify.redirect.uri=http://127.0.0.1:3000
spotify.scope=user-read-private user-read-email playlist-read-private playlist-read-collaborative user-read-playback-state user-modify-playback-state user-library-read user-read-recently-played streaming
```

4. Build and run:
```bash
mvn -f pom.xml org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-maven-plugin:run
```

The backend will start on `http://127.0.0.1:9090`

### 4. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will start on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the startup script to run both backend and frontend:
```bash
./start.sh
```

### Stop / Check Server Status

Use the companion stop script to check service status or stop running servers:
```bash
# Check if backend and frontend are running
./stop.sh status

# Stop both backend and frontend
./stop.sh stop
```

The script detects processes by port (9090 / 3000) and Spring Boot / Python server process patterns, then performs a graceful shutdown followed by a force-kill if any process remains.

## Usage

1. **Login**: Click "Login with Spotify" to authenticate with your Spotify account
2. **Player** (Default Tab): Control playback with play/pause, next, and previous buttons. Seek using:
   - Clickable progress bar (shows time on hover; updates smoothly every 100ms between server syncs)
   - Arrow buttons for ±5/10/15 second jumps
   - Keyboard: **Shift + Left/Right** for ±5 second increments (from anywhere in Player tab)
   - Keyboard (when progress bar is focused): Left/Right for ±5 second increments
   - Volume: Adjust with +/- buttons or slider (shows volume % on hover)
   - If the active device does not support volume control, volume controls are disabled automatically
3. **Search**: Use the search tab to find songs, artists, albums, and playlists. Select **All** to search songs, albums, and playlists together in grouped results.
   - Artist names are clickable and open the Spotify artist page
   - Use **Add to Queue** on tracks to queue without interrupting playback
   - Album **Add to Queue** now queues album tracks via backend expansion
   - Albums include a **Tracks** button to open a detail modal (album items only)
4. **Library**: Browse recently played tracks, liked songs, and your playlists (Recently Played is the default sub-tab)
   - Liked Songs and Recently Played support **Add to Queue**
5. **Devices**: View and select available Spotify devices
6. **Current Queue**: In Player tab, use **Current Queue** panel to view queued tracks and refresh queue state
   - Queue items show album-art thumbnails
   - Queue rows are rendered using Handlebars templates for consistent UI structure
   - Queue is polled every 30 seconds (independent of the 15-second playback poll)

### Error Handling
- **Rate limiting (429)**: Displays a user-friendly message when the Spotify API rate limit is hit, instead of a generic error
- **No active device (404)**: Play/pause/next/previous operations return 404 when no device is active; frontend maps this to a clear prompt to activate a Spotify device
- **Playback commands**: Invalid requests surface clear error messages instead of generic server errors
- **Spotify API errors propagated**: Backend uses `SpotifyApiException` + `GlobalExceptionHandler` to forward Spotify's original status code and message to the client instead of returning a generic 500
- **In-app error notifications**: All error feedback in `library.js` (play playlist, play track, add to queue) uses `Utils.showError()` instead of browser `alert()` dialogs, keeping users in context
- **High-contrast global alerts**: Error and success banners use solid opaque backgrounds (`rgba(133,20,32,0.96)` / `rgba(19,96,53,0.96)`) with white text and a white close button so they remain clearly visible against the dark app background

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab** to navigate between interactive elements
- **Shift + Left/Right** to seek -5/+5 seconds in Player tab
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Left/Right** for previous/next track
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Up/Down** to adjust volume step
- Volume shortcuts are ignored when active device volume control is unsupported
- **Arrow keys** to adjust seek/volume when the relevant slider control is focused
- **Enter/Space** to activate buttons

## Security Considerations

- Access tokens are stored securely in the database
- CORS is configured to allow requests from the frontend origin only
- Refresh tokens are automatically used to obtain new access tokens
- All Spotify API calls require valid authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No devices found"**: Make sure Spotify is open and active on at least one device
2. **"Authentication failed"**: Check your Spotify app credentials and redirect URI
3. **"Database connection error"**: Verify MySQL is running and credentials are correct
4. **"CORS error"**: Ensure the frontend URL is properly configured in CORS settings

### Development Tips

- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Monitor backend logs for API call details
- Use Spotify's Web API documentation for reference
- Test with different device types (desktop, mobile, web player)

### Polling & Rate Limit Validation

Spotify enforces rate limits across all API endpoints. Follow these rules when changing or adding any polling logic:

1. **Minimum polling interval is 15 seconds** — never set `UPDATE_INTERVAL` or any `setInterval` below `15000 ms`.
2. **Queue polling is decoupled** — `QUEUE_UPDATE_INTERVAL` defaults to 30 s and must not be lowered below `UPDATE_INTERVAL`.
3. **No duplicate polling loops** — before adding a new `setInterval` or `setTimeout` loop, confirm no existing loop already covers that endpoint.
4. **Guard against concurrent calls** — always check an `isUpdating` / `isQueueUpdating` flag before firing a new request on the same endpoint.
5. **Silent-fail polling endpoints** — add the endpoint to `pollingEndpoints` in `app.js → handleAjaxError` so 429s on background polls do not surface global error banners.
6. **Test with browser DevTools Network tab** — filter by `/api/spotify/` and verify each endpoint fires at most once per its configured interval.
7. **Check backend logs for 429s** — `backend/logs/spotify-wrapper.log` logs every Spotify API status code; grep for `429` after a test session to confirm no endpoint is being over-polled.
